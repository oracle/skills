# Oracle Skills

Oracle Skills is a collection of practical, installable skills for working with Oracle technologies.

The goal is to give developers and agents a single place to find source-backed Oracle guidance across Oracle Database, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, GraalVM, Oracle Fusion, Oracle APEX, and future domains.

## Installation

Install a domain by appending the root-level domain directory to the repository name:

```bash
npx skills add oracle/skills/db
npx skills add oracle/skills/graal
...
```

## Repository Goals

- Provide Oracle-wide skills in one repository.
- Define domain entry points that help developers and agents route to the right topic quickly.
- Keep each skill practical, source-backed, and easy to consume on demand.
- Allow each domain to evolve its own taxonomy without breaking repo-wide consistency.

## Domains

- `db/` is the active Oracle Database domain and includes database, ORDS, SQLcl, framework, Maximum Availability Architecture, container, and agent workflow skills.
- `oci/` is the root for future Oracle Cloud Infrastructure skills.
- `fusion/` is the root for future Oracle Fusion skills.
- `apex/` is the root for future Oracle APEX skills.
- `graal/` contains GraalVM skills, starting with Native Image.

## Start Here

1. Pick the domain closest to your task.
2. Install that domain skill.
3. Add other domain skills only when needed.

```

Each domain has its own `SKILL.md` and any supporting index files it needs.

For a real domain, organize content by category directories and use `SKILL.md` as the table of contents. A domain `SKILL.md` should normally include:

- `## How to Use This Domain`
- `## Directory Structure`
- `## Category Routing`
- `## Key Starting Points`
- `## Common Multi-Step Flows`

For stub domains, keep `SKILL.md` minimal and point users back to this `README.md` and `SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md`.

## Version Coverage Standard

- Skills that include version-specific behavior must include a section named `## Oracle Version Notes (19c vs 26ai)`.
- Use Oracle Database 19c as the baseline compatibility target unless stated otherwise.
- Explicitly call out features that require newer releases and provide 19c-compatible alternatives where practical.
